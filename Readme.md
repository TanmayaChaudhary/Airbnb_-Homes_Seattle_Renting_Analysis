##  **Airbnb Seattle Data Analysis**

In this project we are going to explore the Airbnb Seattle Data for gaining some business related insights.

## 1. Installations

The required libraries for running the code within Jupiter notebook are part of the Anaconda distribution for Python 3.6.7. Following libraries were used:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

## 2. Project Motivation

This project explored the utility of Airbnb, Seattle dataset for obtaining insights to remain competitive in the market. <br/> The CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) pipeline was followed focussing on insights for "How to make listing more affordable for the people?". <br/> The specific questions were:

* Q1->How many days in a year homes are available for rent in Seattle?

* Q2->What's the trend of house renting in Seattle?

* Q3->What's the renting charges of houses in the Seattle?

* Q4->What's the trend of pricing through the whole year in Seattle?

## 3. Files Description

**Airbnb_Seattle.ipynb**<br/>
This notebook presents the work related to addressing the above questions. The code for cleaning, engineering, and modeling data along with the markdown describing the process is presented.

**seattle.zip**<br/>
This zip file contains the data I used to perform the analysis. It contains 3 files as calendar.csv, listing.csv, rviews.csv.<br/> The original source of the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) is Kaggle.


## 4. Result of analysis

From the analysis we can safely say the that:<br/>
* Seattle listings appear to have more availability through out the year, which may be reducing prices for those listings.
* There are generally weekend price hike for Seattle homes because people come more on weekends there.
* In Seattle, visitors care more about getting a cozy place there.

* So I think people are choosing the houses based on their comfort level?
